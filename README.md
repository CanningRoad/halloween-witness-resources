## Directories

	/docx - Contains ready-to-print word documents of the crafts and some signs
	/png - Contains image files of the craft pages which can be imported into any desktop publishing package
	/svg - Contains the original source files for the graphics

## Editing

The SVG files are the original source files, and these can be edited in Inkscape. Adobe Illustrator will probably work fine as well.

## DOCX and PNG files

The PNG files are images which can be imported into your desktop publishing package of choice for printing. I recommend using borderless printing.

The DOCX files are Word Documents (requires a modern version of Word) with no margins. The images are designed to compensate for the natural margins of most home printers (inkjet or laser)
