Resources for running a halloween witness in your neighbourhood. Check out our blog post to see how we used these: [Our halloween witness][blog]

## Directories

### Pre 2020

```
/docx - Contains ready-to-print word documents of the crafts and some signs
/png - Contains image files of the craft pages which can be imported into any desktop publishing package
/svg - Contains the original source files for the graphics
```

### New for 2021

Do you ever feel scared? What are you afraid of?

In 2021, we are providing kids with a choice of two "poster kits" that they can hang in their rooms to remind them that God is for them, and loves them, and that his light cannot be overcome by darkness. They are designed to be decorated with colouring pens, and stick-on items like gems and emoji stickers.

See the directory `/2021` which contains printable A4 PDFs, and source images in PNG and SVG.

The fonts are League Spartan and 'Lived Mas'

## Editing

The SVG files are the original source files, and these can be edited in Inkscape. Adobe Illustrator will probably work fine as well.

### Fonts

The custom fonts used in this project are:

 + [League Spartan](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-spartan)
 + [Cabin](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/cabin)
 + [Lived Mas](https://www.fontspace.com/lived-mas-new-with-numbers-font-f22013)
 
These are all free to use.

## DOCX and PNG files

The PNG files are images which can be imported into your desktop publishing package of choice for printing. I recommend using borderless printing.

The DOCX files are Word Documents (requires a modern version of Word) with no margins. The images are designed to compensate for the natural margins of most home printers (inkjet or laser)
